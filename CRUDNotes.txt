The CRUD...

CRUD: 
	- Create 
	- Read
	- Update
	- Delete
	
These all pertain to operations performed on/in the database. Any .php scripts that Create, Read, Update, 
or Delete anything on the database must be placed into the CRUD directory. 

Now, within the CRUD directory are all the pages (exceptions being mobile, general***, and competitions) of 
the web application. Each page will have its own directory, thus, each "page" directory will
have its own CRUD operations that are specific to its page. For example, the admin page is 
the only page that can add a WOD for a specific box, therefore the script that CREATES ("insert" for DB terms)
the WOD will be placed in the following path: /CRUD/admin/ 

To call scripts from that directory is exactly the same as it was before except you have to add
the path to the script instead of just calling the script. For example:

/*** OLD WAY ***/
$.ajax({
	type: "POST",
	url: "adminAddWOD.php",
	data: data,
	dataType: "text",
	success: function(response) {
		console.log(response);
	}
}); 

/*** NEW WAY ***/
$.ajax({
	type: "POST",
	url: "/CRUD/amdin/adminAddWOD.php",
	data: data,
	dataType: "text",
	success: function(response) {
		console.log(response);
	}
}); 

*** General means that the script is used across multiple pages. Example: the logout script that 
destroys session data. Instead of placing that script in all directories, just place it in the /general
directory for all pages to use.
