Garrett Tasks:
	***WILL BE UPDATED FREQUENTLY***
	1. Create a Box Management page for administrators to adjust box info ($20.00)
		a. Basically copy and paste the account management page and make it work with box information
		b. I'll add the link from the Admin Page
	
	ALL PAGES
	2. Adjust the nav bar positions across all pages to be even ($5.00)
		- This will be tricky, you'll have to test across different monitor sizes and different browsers
	
	PROGRESS PAGE
	3. Style the "New Open Data" and "Add some PR's" button to match color scheme ($2.00)
	4. Style the modals that the aforementioned buttons open to match the color scheme ($3.00)
	5a. Make the Olympic lifts (from clicking on the Olympic Sub Nav Bar) clickable ($5.00)
		- I want users to be able to click the lift without the text changing color or being underlined
		- Make sure to ID the links appropriately, as you will need them for the next task
	5b. Show the user's progress from whichever lift they clicked overtime ($20.00)
		- Display the users' log in the off-green sections beneath the section where the lists are displayed
		- My log for my snatch progress, for example:
			+ 1/18/2013 165lbs
			+ 3/15/2013 175lbs
			+ 10/21/2013 185lbs
			+ 2/14/2014 190lbs
		- Just display it like that for the time being
