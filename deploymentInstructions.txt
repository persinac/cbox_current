How we are going to deploy from now on:

1) We are going to have a build_<date> folder on the server
	a) the date is to be the date that the build is being released

2) All files created/edited/modified from the current time TO the build date will be placed in this build
	a) They will however, follow the same folder structure as the /var/www/ directory
