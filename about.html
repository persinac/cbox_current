          <h2 class="featurette-heading">How it began...</h2>
          <p class="lead">It all started when I first discovered this blog, forum style thing hosted on Crossfit.com. I was a senior in highschool, played varsity tennis, and was about to transition into College. So of course I was looking to get stronger, faster, and have those washboard abs. I googled Crossfit, saw pictures of people that looked as if they were Spartans from 300, and knew that I wanted to dive in.</p><p>

And that's exactly what I did, but at my local YMCA. The workout was double unders and kettlebell swings — a real burner. I did awful and didn't quite find it as appealing as I thought it would be, but I didn’t find it too difficult; thus, I redirected my focus toward other forms of training. A year later I came back into it and associated myself with my first box: Crossfit Frederick. My first WoD at Crossfit Frederick was Deck of Cards. I was hooked. Fast forward three years, and I've received my CF level 1 Certificate to coach (at my first box), I was significantly stronger, faster, and leaner; and I wanted to take my training to the next level. I wanted to compete in an actual competition.</p><p>

My first competition. Many people that I know who want to compete start out in Novice, or Intermediate. Not me though. Go figure I want to compete Rx. So I did, and I place 19th (out of 21). Pretty awful, but it's really not too bad for my first debut. It wasn’t until after that competition that I realized competing in your box and competing outside of your box is entirely different. From the friends you know to the competition from the outside world.

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">The idea</h2>
          <p class="lead">Within your box, you know the stats that your friendly competition has, their back squat max, their Fran time, their strengths and their weaknesses — because you want to beat them. </p><p>

That’s when I came up with the idea of a competitive Crossfit app. Not just a workout tracker, or a WoD tracker, but a way to compare yourself to people around you as well as the people you are completely unaware of; thus, CBox was born. </p><p>

Being a computer science student, I knew (vaguely) how to program. I took a web development class during my last semester, took the concepts and projects I learned and completed, and applied them to a mock up site similar to the one you are reading about.

          <h2 class="featurette-heading"> A little background</h2>
          <p class="lead">But just like the rest of you, I have a life outside of Crossfit: I am a systems developer working that 8-5 grind. So far so good, I enjoy my work, and I enjoy pursuing projects in and outside of my field. I find my motivation to develop through a lack of efficiency in every day life. Technology progresses to make our lives better, not worse, and I want to ensure that my mark follows that trend. </p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">The BIG outlook</h2>
              <p class="lead">My outlook for this web application started small, that is until I pitched the idea to my friend, Zach Brown.</p><p>Thanks to his thoughts, his partnership, and his ideas, this is now a small startup and a big web application. We hope it will provide the type of service that we would use every day, for 10 years. We have exceptionally high standards for an application such as this, and we know that our users will as well. We intend on adhering to our statement that this application will be community-driven, and ultimately that the community that garner from this application will use this for as long as we do.
