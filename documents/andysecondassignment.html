					Create a second page with the standard html page structure. Right click on this page, click on inspect element,
					 and refer to this page as your structure.</br>
					Tasks:
						<ul id="first_list">
							<li> You will create a navigation bar</li>
							<ul id="sub-list">
								<li>Be located at the top of the page</li>
								<li>Its style will be inline (horizontal)</li>
								<li>It will be Right justified (hug the ride side of the page)</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Underneath the navigation bar you will create 5 div elements</li>
							<ul id="sub-list">
								<li>The first element will be centered, and will have information about HTML attributes, and why 
								I use the #, the period, and nothing in my CSS sheet linked at the bottom.</li>
								<li>The second element will contain nothing and serve as a divider between the 1st and 3rd div. It will be 
								drawn like so: <div id="example_line"></div></li>
								<li>The third element will be left justified. It will contain a table that list your top 3 favorite games and their publishers. 
								Its structure will have 2 headers, one for the game title, one for the publisher. The publisher column will have a link to the 
								publisher's website</li>
								<li>The fourth element will be exactly like the second element. Literally copy and paste.</li>
								<li>The fifth element will be right justified. It will be a picture of Master Chief, and will be a clickable link that takes 
								me to a video of Red vs Blue on YouTube.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Use a cascading style sheet (CSS) to style this page</li>
							<ul id="sub-list">
								<li>Body background color = #5C5C5C</li>
								<li>Each of your div elements have different border colors</li>
							</ul>

					<ul id="second_list">
						<li>Create a second navigation bar that is vertical, but is a side navbar. Doesn't have to link to anything.</li>

				<ul>
					<li>Div elements are your best friend.</li>
					<li>Your css page will look like this: <a href="dist/css/andy_page.css" rel="stylesheet">Sheet</a></li>
					<ul id="second_list">
						<li><i>In fact, it will look almost identical to the one that is linked except the elements will be different.</i></li>
						<li><i>I want you to save it in the same file directory as well: dist/css/ and name it my_first_style.css</i></li>
					</ul>
					<li>A navbar (navigation bar) is simply a list, in a horizontal fashion, and is styled. You do not have to make this
					 one look fancy. Here is what you have to do in your html file: put the list element (ul) in a div, place the div at 
					 the top of the page. In your CSS file, here is what you do: specify the div element a position, (ie. position: static;),
					 ensure it is at the top of the page - the div - (position the element by using the top and left attributes), specify a
					  ul element and an li element, in the ul element type the following: list-style-type: none; and the li element type
					  the following: display: inline;</li>
