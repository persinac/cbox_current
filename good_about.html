          <h2 class="featurette-heading">How it began...</h2>
          <p class="lead">It all began when I first discovered this blog, forum style thing hosted on Crossfit.com. I was a senior in highschool, played varsity tennis, and was about to transition into College. So of course I was looking to get stronger, faster, and have those washboard abs. I googled Crossfit, saw pictures of people that looked as if they came straight from 300, and knew that I wanted to dive in. </p><p>

I did exactly that, but at my local YMCA. The workout was double unders and kettlebell swings, a real burner. I did awful, but I didn’t find it difficult or as appealing as I thought it would be. Thus I redirected my focus towards other forms of training. A year later I came back into it and associated myself with my first box: Crossfit Frederick. My first WoD there was Deck of Cards. I was hooked. Fast forward three years, I've received my CF level 1 Certificate to coach (at my first box), I was significantly stronger, faster, and leaner; and I wanted to take my training to the next level. I wanted to compete in an actual competition. </p><p>

My first competition. Many people I know that want to compete start out in Novice, or Intermediate, not me though, go figure I want to compete Rx. So I did, and I place 19th (out of 21). Pretty awful, but not bad for my first debut. It wasn’t until after that competition that I realized competing in your box and competing outside of your box is entirely different. From the friends you know to the competition from the outside world.

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">The idea</h2>
          <p class="lead">Within your box, you know the stats that your friendly competition has, their back squat max, their Fran time, their strengths and their weaknesses; because you want to beat them. </p><p>

That’s when I came up with the idea of a competitive Crossfit app. Not just a workout tracker, or a WoD tracker, but a way to compare yourself to people around you, and the people you are completely unaware of. Thus, the birth of CBox came about. </p><p>

Being a Computer Science student, I knew (vaguely) how to program. I took a web development class during my last semester, took the concepts and projects I learned and completed, and applied them to a mock up site similar to the one you are reading about.

          <h2 class="featurette-heading"> A little background</h2>
          <p class="lead">I'm no regional competitor, or even an open competitor (I'd love to be, don't get me wrong), I'm just another guy that loves to push his body to the limit. In regards to Crossfit, I've stuck with it for around 4 years now, and haven't gotten sick of it, must be that whole constantly varied idea. I've competed in 2 Crossfit competitions and 1 strongman competition. In May 2013, I took the Level 1 Crossfit Certification so that I could scream at people and tell them their squat looks terrible (sarcasm). I've learned to love the "M" word all Crossfitters cringe upon hearing - Mobility - and stress the importance of it to each and every person I coach. I continue to coach and workout whenever I have free time! </p><p>
          
          As for Computer Science and what I actually do for a living. I am an Systems Developer working that 8-5 grind. So far so good, I enjoy my work, and I enjoy pursuing projects in and outside of my field. I find my motivation to develop through lack of efficiency in every day life. Technology progresses to make our lives better, not worse, and I want to ensure that my mark follows that trend. </p><p>
          
          My outlook for this small startup and web application is for it to provide the type of service that I would use every day, for 10 years. I have high standards for an application such as this, and I know that my users will as well. I intend on adhering to my statement that this application will be Community driven, and that the community that I obtain from this application will use this for as long as I do.

          My outlook for this web application started small. Until I pitched the idea to my friend, Zach Brown. With his thoughts, his partnership, and his idea's, this is now a small startup and a big web application.</p><p> We desire for it to provide the type of service that we would use every day, for 10 years. We have exceptionally high standards for an application such as this, and we know that our users will as well. We intend on adhering to our statement that this application will be Community driven, and that the community that we obtain from this application will use this for as long as we do.
