The build directory will contain directories pertaining to release dates (build dates)

We will release every Tuesday pretty much. The next build date will be 2014-09-09. 
The build directory for that release date is labeled: build20140909
Build directories are labeled: build<date> ... 

Inside each build directory will be the following directories:
	- CRUD
		/admin
		/compare
		/competitions
		/general
		/mobile
		/profiles
		/progress
		/wod
	- CSS
	- JS
	
Every change you make on the test site, I need you to put the changed files into the appropriate directory 
of the build directory. The reason I do this is because of the way I have to place new files on the 
live server. This also helps in keeping track of builds and what we changed. If you feel so inclined, you 
can keep a build log in each build directory to track the changes made - however that is not necessary 
as of today (2014-09-02).
